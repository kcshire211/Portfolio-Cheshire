# Portfolio Update

https://kcshire211.github.io/Portfolio-Cheshire/

I've used the skills I have learned so far to put together an application to display a bit about me, my portfolio and some examples, my resume, and links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles. 

## Homework Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

## Technologies and languages I used for this assignment

HTML, CSS, Bulma library, VS Code, GitHub, Google fonts

## HTML

I decided to use 3 separate HTML pages. My index.html page acts just as an index, with button links to various other html pages and external links. My 'about me' section is one of those other html pages. I chose to have it as a separate page in order to have a nice, clean space for a bio and picture of myself. My portfolio page is too a separate html file, including screenshots for three previous projects/assignments, as well as deployed page links and Github repo links for each. The buttons for Github and LinkedIn link directly to my profile on those sites. 



## CSS

I used the Bulma CSS library to give my Portfolio a nice, sleek look. I prefer a page to be not over-cluttered or noisy, and I feel that Bulma does a great job at this. 

## LinkedIn

Due to rules with my current employer, my LinkedIn is not updated with any skills or proficiencies related to programming or web development. I will update this prior to applying for any new jobs.
